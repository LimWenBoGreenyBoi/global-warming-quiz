    {
      "q": "What increases Earth's radiative forcing?",
      "options": ["Higher atmospheric CO₂", "Increased volcanic aerosols", "Reduced solar output", "Greater cloud albedo"],
      "answer": 0,
      "explanation": "Higher atmospheric CO₂ increases radiative forcing by trapping more outgoing longwave radiation."

    {
      "q": "Which personal action most reduces emissions?",
      "options": ["Switching to renewable electricity", "Buying bottled water", "Increasing air conditioning use", "Longer daily commutes"],
      "answer": 0,
      "explanation": "Switching to renewable electricity directly cuts emissions associated with power use."

    {
      "q": "A major source of methane emissions is?",
      "options": ["Wetlands and livestock", "Desert sands", "Polar sea ice", "Granite bedrock"],
      "answer": 0,
      "explanation": "Natural wetlands and livestock are major methane sources; deserts and ice are not."
    },
    {
      "q": "How does deforestation affect climate?",
      "options": ["Reduces carbon sinks and alters albedo", "Raises global rainfall instantly", "Lowers atmospheric CO₂", "Cools the oceans"],
      "answer": 0,
      "explanation": "Deforestation reduces carbon sinks and changes surface reflectivity (albedo), contributing to warming."
    },
    {
      "q": "Sulfate aerosols tend to?",
      "options": ["Cool by reflecting sunlight", "Warm by trapping infrared", "Have no climate effect", "Increase greenhouse gas concentrations"],
      "answer": 0,
      "explanation": "Sulfate aerosols scatter sunlight, producing a cooling effect that partially offsets greenhouse warming."
    },
    {
      "q": "The carbon budget refers to?",
      "options": ["Allowable emissions to meet warming targets", "Government spending plans", "Household energy bills", "Forest area worldwide"],
      "answer": 0,
      "explanation": "The carbon budget is the remaining allowable emissions to meet temperature targets (e.g., 1.5–2°C)."
    },
    {
      "q": "Permafrost thaw can lead to?",
      "options": ["Release of stored methane and CO₂", "More reflective sea ice", "Immediate global rainfall increase", "Soil stabilization"],
      "answer": 0,
      "explanation": "Thawing permafrost releases previously trapped methane and CO₂, amplifying warming."
    },

      "answer": 0,
      "explanation": "The Paris Agreement’s central goal is to limit warming well below 2°C, pursuing 1.5°C."
